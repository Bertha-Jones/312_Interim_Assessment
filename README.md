# Inventory System for Shoprite

This is an inventory system we made for Shoprite as an interim assessment for our DCIT 312 programming course. It was made as an assessment of our skills with the C# programming language and how versed we were in making graphical user interfaces. 
The inventory system contains forms for:
* Admin
* Attendants
* Product
* Product Categories
* Sales and Orders

### Apology Note
Sir, please if you are going to see this, I'm pleading with you to consider me regarding the time of commit because this is the second repository I am making for the project as the first one was deleted due to git issues. So I had to create a new repository and push all my files there recently. I really hope you will take my unplanned setback into account and consider grading my work, Thank you sir!!
